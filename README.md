I’ll use Python with the Boto3 library to interact with DynamoDB, and I’ll create a basic script that can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Prerequisites
AWS Account: You need an AWS account to use DynamoDB.
AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI with your credentials.
Python: Install Python (preferably 3.x).
Boto3: Install the Boto3 library using pip (pip install boto3).
Git: Install Git and create a GitHub account if you don’t have one.
